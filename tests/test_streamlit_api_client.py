"""
Module: tests/test_streamlit_api_client.py

Purpose:
    This module supports automated regression tests for the PowerCenter to IDMC migration assessment platform.

Responsibilities:
    - Provide the code and data structures needed by this part of the application.
    - Integrate with the surrounding parsing, validation, automation, API, or reporting workflow as appropriate.
    - Keep inputs and outputs consistent with the project reporting pipeline so downstream modules can consume them reliably.

Architecture Context:
    The file belongs to the automated regression tests area and verifies expected behavior for parser, validation, API, AI recommendation, and reporting workflows. It participates in the overall input -> processing -> output lifecycle where PowerCenter XML metadata and generated reports are transformed into migration readiness, validation, and AI recommendation insights.

Inputs and Outputs:
    Inputs generally include configuration values, XML-derived metadata, CSV/JSON report rows, API payloads, or test fixtures. Outputs are returned Python objects, API responses, generated report records, or assertions that protect expected behavior.

    Represents the FakeHTTPResponse component in the automated regression tests area.
    
    Purpose:
        Provide a named object that groups related state and behavior for this module.
    
    Responsibilities:
        - Encapsulate the data or operations required by the surrounding workflow.
        - Collaborate with parser, validation, automation, API, or report components where this class is used.
        - Keep behavior predictable so migration assessment outputs remain traceable and easy to review.
    
    Architecture Notes:
        This class is part of the project layer that verifies expected behavior for parser, validation, API, AI recommendation, and reporting workflows. Instances or class methods are used by higher-level orchestration code, services, tests, or report builders without changing business rules.
