"""
Module: api/routes/__init__.py

Purpose:
    This module supports FastAPI service layer for the PowerCenter to IDMC migration assessment platform.

Responsibilities:
    - Provide the code and data structures needed by this part of the application.
    - Integrate with the surrounding parsing, validation, automation, API, or reporting workflow as appropriate.
    - Keep inputs and outputs consistent with the project reporting pipeline so downstream modules can consume them reliably.

Architecture Context:
    The file belongs to the FastAPI service layer area and exposes validation, recommendation, and evaluation results to UI and integration clients. It participates in the overall input -> processing -> output lifecycle where PowerCenter XML metadata and generated reports are transformed into migration readiness, validation, and AI recommendation insights.

Inputs and Outputs:
    Inputs generally include configuration values, XML-derived metadata, CSV/JSON report rows, API payloads, or test fixtures. Outputs are returned Python objects, API responses, generated report records, or assertions that protect expected behavior.
